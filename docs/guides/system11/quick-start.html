      <ol>
        <li>Power off the pinball machine.</li>
        <li>Remove the main processor chip from the System 11 board. Place it into the Warped Pinball System 11 WiFi board’s 40-pin socket, matching pin #1 and checking for bent pins.</li>
        <li>Insert the pin strips into the main board socket. Press firmly on each pin so it seats fully.</li>
        <li>Insert the round-pin chip carrier into the socket strips.</li>
        <li>Attach the sticky standoff and screw to the System 11 PCB and peel the backing.</li>
        <li>Place the board into the main-board socket, confirm all pins are seated, and make sure the processor orientation matches the original.</li>
        <li>Inspect the reset circuit for modifications. Clip the white wire at the junction of <code>R55</code> and <code>R56</code> (the trace connecting them).</li>
        <li>Power on the game and connect a smartphone to the <strong>WarpedPinball</strong> WiFi network. Click <strong>Sign In</strong> if prompted.</li>
        <li>Review the configuration page that appears.</li>
        <li>Select your home WiFi SSID and password. Choose your game and software version from the dropdown. If not listed, select <strong>GenericSystem11</strong> and contact Warped Pinball.</li>
        <li>Set a Pinball Admin password only if you want the Admin/Service page protected (it already requires being on your WiFi).</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>, wait one minute, then power off the game.</li>
        <li>Power on and wait for the IP address to appear on the display (GenericSystem11 will not show one). Enter the IP on any device on the same WiFi—for example <code>192.168.1.189</code>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Enjoy the game and chase new high scores! Enter player names so everyone gets an individual best-score board.</p>
      <p>Set adjustment numbers <strong>18</strong>, <strong>19</strong>, <strong>20</strong>, and <strong>21</strong> to zero to prevent the game from awarding credits when initials are entered.</p>
      <p>Your kit includes a jumper wire for System 11 boot-up sound board issues and a plastic hex standoff for System 9 installations. Some games mount the main board upright—orientation may differ from photos.</p>
