# Quick Start Installation Guide

**System 11 WiFi Quick Start, Version 1.1**
Check out our installation videos at [WarpedPinball.com](https://WarpedPinball.com).
If you are installing in System 9, please see our website for the dedicated guide.

1. Power off your pinball machine.
2. Carefully remove the main processor chip from the System 11 main board. Place it into the Warped Pinball System 11 WiFi board’s 40-pin socket, paying attention to pin #1 orientation and checking for bent pins before inserting.
3. Insert the pin strips into the main board socket and verify they are fully seated. Press firmly on the top of each pin to ensure they are fully inserted into the old processor socket.
4. Insert the round pin chip carrier into the socket strips.
5. Place the sticky standoff and screw on the Warped Pinball System 11 PCB. Peel the backing.
6. Carefully place the board into the socket on the main board. Ensure all pins are fully seated and the sticky pad is adhered. Press firmly around the pin connections and confirm the processor chip matches its original orientation.
7. Inspect the reset circuit area for modifications. Modified boards may cause unexpected results. Clip the white wire at the junction of R55 and R56 (see the trace connecting R55 and R56 in the picture).
8. Power on the game and connect a smartphone to the “WarpedPinball” WiFi network. Wait for the connection and click **Sign In** if prompted.
9. Review the configuration/sign-in page that appears.
10. Select your home WiFi SSID and enter the password. Choose your game with its software version from the drop-down list. If your game is not listed, select **GenericSystem11** and contact Warped Pinball to confirm compatibility.
11. Enter a Pinball Admin password only if you want the Admin/Service page protected (it is already restricted to your WiFi network).
12. Click **Save**, wait one minute, then power off your game.
13. Power on your game and wait for the IP address to appear on the display (not shown if you selected GenericSystem11). On any device connected to your local WiFi, enter the IP address in a browser, e.g., `192.168.1.189` (remember to include the periods, as they are not shown on the pinball display).

Enjoy the game and chase new high scores! Enter player names so everyone gets an individual best-score board.

Adjust game settings as usual. Set adjustment numbers **18**, **19**, **20**, and **21** to zero to prevent the game from awarding credits whenever a player’s initials are entered.

Full installation instructions and videos are available on [WarpedPinball.com](https://WarpedPinball.com). Your kit includes a jumper wire for boot-up sound board issues on System 11 and a plastic hex standoff for System 9 installations (see the full instructions for System 9).

Pictures in this guide show the typical orientation for System 11 games. Some games use main boards installed in the opposite orientation (upright so the text is readable).
