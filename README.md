# Vector

Vector is a modern hardware and software solution that brings advanced features to classic pinball machines while preserving their original gameplay. It allows your Williams/Bally System 9 and 11 games (with plans for WPC and Data East support in 2025) to take advantage of modern electronics and connectivity.

## Features

- **ZERO subscriptions or dependancies** There are no servers to fail, no services to pay for. You don't even really need to connect to the internet. We don't (and can't) control your device in any way once you purchase it. You may *optionally* install our free updates. 
- **WiFi connectivity**: Securly access all the great features of vector from any device on your local internet. There's zero "phone-home" or data collection. Don't belive us? You can read the source code right here on github. 
- **Adjustments Profiles**: Change your games adjustments / settings through the web interface with a single button click. Save up to 4 profiles so you can easilly switch between your "free play", "Tournament", and "Arcade" adjustments, or anything else you like.
- **Live Scores**: Watch scores for inprogress games change in realtime with fun effects.
- **Extended Leaderboard**: Expand the high scores on your machine to 20 slots
- **Personal Leaderboards**: Each registered player gets their own scoreboard with their personal best scores. (This is great for kids who dont make it on the leaderboard!)
- **Tournament Board**: Do you have "the pinball crew" come over to play a tournament and take all the high scores? then enable tournament mode which records every game in chronilogical order and keeps the scores seperate from the standard leaderboard.
- **Initials for System 9**: Williams / Bally System 9 games don't natively support initials on high scores. Vector adds support by allowing users to enter their intials in the web interface after a game.
- **Over-the-Air Updates**: Easily update your Vector with the latest features. Your board will never automatically install software without you 
- **Unaltered Gameplay**: Enjoy modern features without changing the classic feel.
